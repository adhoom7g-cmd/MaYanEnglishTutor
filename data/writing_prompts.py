Subject: Re: Your Recent Stay - Reservation #MG332211 - Our Sincere Apologies

Dear Mr. Chen,

Thank you for taking the time to bring these issues to our attention. I sincerely apologize for the problems you experienced during your stay from October 10-13. This falls far short of the service standards we strive to maintain at Ma'yan Grand Hotel.

Let me address each of your concerns:

Air Conditioning Issue:
You are absolutely right to be frustrated that it took three days to resolve the air conditioning problem in Room 405. This is unacceptable, especially after you reported it on your first day. I have investigated this matter and discovered that there was a miscommunication between our front desk and maintenance departments, which caused the delay. We have now implemented a new priority system to ensure urgent maintenance requests are addressed within 2 hours.

Construction Noise:
I apologize that the early morning construction noise disturbed your stay. While this construction is beyond our control (the neighboring building is not owned by our hotel), we should have proactively informed you at check-in and offered you a room on the opposite side of the building, away from the noise. This was our failure.

Staff Response:
I'm particularly concerned that our staff appeared dismissive of your complaints. This does not reflect our values, and I have addressed this with the team members involved. Every guest concern should be treated with empathy and urgency.

To make amends, I would like to offer you:
1. A full refund of one night's accommodation ($250)
2. A complimentary two-night stay at our hotel within the next year, in one of our deluxe rooms
3. A complimentary dinner for two at our rooftop restaurant (value $150)

I want to assure you that we have learned from this experience. We have:
- Improved our maintenance response procedures
- Retrained our front desk staff on handling complaints
- Updated our room assignment protocols during construction periods

Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve. I hope you will give us another opportunity to provide you with the exceptional service you deserved from the beginning.

If you would like to discuss this further, please feel free to contact me directly at gm@mayangrand.com or +123-456-7890 ext. 101.

Once again, please accept my sincere apologies.

Best regards,

Michael Stevens
